# Backend Setup for Image Inpainting with GAN


## ⚡ Setting Up & Running the API (Backend)

After correctly placing the models in the `api/model/` folder, follow these steps to start the backend using FastAPI:

Refer to this [readme](../frontend/README.md) for setting up model in correct place.

1. **Navigate to the API directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Minor_ArtiFuse/api
   ```
2. **Run the API server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
This will start the FastAPI server, ensuring the backend is operational.

Enjoy seamless image restoration powered by GANs!
